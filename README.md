![App Preview](https://login.trace.zip/storage/v1/object/public/trace/331ea0e8-c6ca-43d2-999c-d5b3a0fc47cd)

This iOS app primarily displays a terminal-like interface where users can input commands and view the output. The app is built using SwiftUI and is compatible with iOS devices.

## Features

- Terminal-like interface with input and output sections
- Monospaced font for a more authentic terminal experience
- Dark mode support
- Keyboard handling for smooth user experience

## Building the App

To build the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on your preferred iOS device or simulator.

## App Structure

The app consists of a single `ContentView` which contains the following elements:

- A `ScrollView` displaying the output text.
- A `TextField` for entering commands.
- A `Button` for executing commands.

The `executeCommand()` function is called when the user taps the button, which appends the input text to the output text and clears the input field.

The `hideKeyboard()` function is used to dismiss the keyboard when the input field loses focus.

## Preview

You can preview the app using the `ContentView_Previews` struct provided in the code.
